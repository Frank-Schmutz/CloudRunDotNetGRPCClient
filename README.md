This repo serves as a minimal example of a gRPC client for a server deployed on GCP Cloud Run

**Steps to run this client**

In the `Program.cs` file replace the value of the `SERVER_ADDRESS` constant by the address of your Cloud Run Service.

Run the client either in visual studio or build and run it in the command line:

`dotnet build`

`dotnet run`
